************************************************* 11 am **************************************************************

stubbed all endroutes and created views for each route with a description in HTTP RESPONSE on what the function does and
who is allowed access or can view . i wrote everything out from scratch and did not use any intell


came across an error 'attribute error at /'

it was because i added a comma at the end of my return statements.



i was advised to narrow down what is more important and to complete that first.

1. Add post on the main page
2. add discussion page
3. up comming events page
4. library
5. gallery
6. creating a membership would really be last
