****************************************** 3pm update *****************************************************************

2:00 pm

 so far I have completed my models, i still have to create a super user and get access to the admin. I also need to
 import the models in my admin and create forms using my models. My goal is to finish that before i turn in my update at
 3pm. so 45 minutes to get it into.



i made an addMember model just to hsve it coded and ready but wont implement it until the important factors are complete.


2:21 pm

I have imported my models in my admin and registered them. Also will make migrations, Now working in the python file forms
 and going to add the two starred points at the top.

 *from django import forms
 *from .models import {ALL MODElS}

 I was having a hard time and many errors in my models because i was using the required field and it didnt exist, but i
 solved the problem reading the error and my models are successfully made.

 I created a superuser using the command line

 * python manage.py createsuperuser
Super User created
username : student
password: C0d3Cr3w
