***************************************************** 11am update ****************************************************

So far my models are in the admin and i have a super user created that allows me into the admin site. My models is popping
in the admin.

i started off by importing all my models into my forms python file

* from .models import {MODEL NAME}, {MODEL NAME}
* from django import forms



I Added all the models and turned them into forms in my python forms file. and now im working on my views. first but importing
all the forms created at the top

*from .forms import {FORM NAME}
when you import forms its automatically imports the models if the models were imported in the forms file.
