3:50 pm: Added a little nav bar to start of with and finally getting some content on the webpage!. Its just the skeleton but i am
happy somethings there to see. I am getting addicted to seeing results and realize that a clear mind and a clean house and
nothing on my to-do list is the key to success.


4:09 pm : I just added two discussion post and it poppped up on the correct page, however it is just printing out
DiscussionEntryModel(1). I am guessing its because in my for loop i didnt specify which attributes i wanted to print.
Create Discussion Post saves into the front page. Now have to check my admin and see if it added it!


Discussion Successfully can be added to the admin site !
 i added some photos as proof under todays update folder
